# Research: Web-Based Reading Notes App

## Objective
Investigate the technical feasibility and best practices for implementing a lightweight, web-based reading notes application.

## Key Findings

### Offline Functionality
- **Approach**: Use Service Workers to enable offline note-taking.
- **Tools**: Workbox library for managing caching and offline capabilities.

### Frontend Framework
- **Recommendation**: React for its component-based architecture and ecosystem support.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Vue.js, Svelte (not chosen due to team familiarity with React).

### Backend Requirements
- **Scope**: Minimal backend functionality required; focus on serving static files and handling optional user authentication.
- **Tools**: Node.js with Express for simplicity.

### Testing Framework
- **Recommendation**: Jest for unit and integration testing.
- **Rationale**: Widely used, good documentation, and React compatibility.

### Performance Optimization
- **Goals**: Initial load time < 3 seconds, interaction latency < 100ms.
- **Techniques**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient state management.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize data model design.
2. Define API contracts (if needed).
3. Develop a quickstart guide for setting up the development environment.
